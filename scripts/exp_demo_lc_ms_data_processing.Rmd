# We firstly define the parameters for feature annotation

# 'polarity' is required, can be either 'negative' or 'positive';
# 'perc_fwhm' is used to set the percentage of the width of the FWHM for peak grouping. 
#              Default is set to 0.6;
# 'mz_abs_iso' is used to set the allowed variance for the search (for isotope annotation). 
#              The default is set to 0.005;
# 'max_charge' is set the maximum number of the isotope charge. 
#              For example, the default is 2, therefore the max isotope charge is 2+/-;
# 'max_iso' is used to set the maximum number of isotope peaks.
#              For example, the default is 2, therefore the max number of isotopes per peaks is 2;
# 'corr_eic_th' is used to set the threshold for intensity correlations across samples. 
#              Default is set to 0.85.
# 'mz_abs_add' is used to set the allowed variance for the search (for adduct annotation). 
#              Default is set to 0.001.
# 'adducts' is used to specify the adducts based on your instrument settings.

# annParams, is the object created using the SetAnnotationParam function above;
# filtIso, is used to decide to filter out all isotopes (TRUE) or not (FALSE);
# filtAdducts, is used to decide to filter out all adducts (TRUE) or not (FALSE);
# missPercent, specify the threshold to remove features missing in a certain percentage
#              of all samples in a group.
